        <p class="text-faded">
            I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time talking about iteration #1 of this portfolio.
            It was very similar to what you see here, but took me exponentially more time to create. 
            It was written in Vue, which was fun at first but became very intensive the more I added.
            I'm not a web developer (as you might have intuited) and I don't want to be, so jekyll is great. 
            I needed to update the site and saw that github was hosting jekyll sites for free with a way better 
            load time that heroku, and here we are.
        </p>

            If you want to check out the old site there's a link below to the source code as well as the running
            site hosted on heroku.
