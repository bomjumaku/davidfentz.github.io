        This was a pragmatically driven project. I had just bought some soldering equipment, and was really 
        getting into electronics as a hobby. I needed a power supply to test circuits before final deployment, 
        and I needed a fume extractor to save my lungs. Venting to the outdoors was not an option, so filtering 
        was the next best thing.

        Figure 1 shows me testing the PC power supply that I had converted to a lab power supply with one of the 12v 
        fans that are used in the fume extractor shown in figure 2. It's a pretty simple power supply. It's got 
        12v, 5v, 3.3v, and ground (with a few connections for each). I added an LED to indicate when everything 
        is hot, and a switch so that I can power everything off without unplugging it.

        Figure 2 shows my fume extractor, which takes the cake for the most hideous thing I have ever built with my 
        hands. However, as you can see it is practical. It's using 3 12v fans from an old server so it's got a lot of 
        power. In addition to that, the front swings open so that I can change out the layers of carbon/HEPA filters really quickly.

        And before you ask; no, I don't vape bro. That thing is used exclusively for testing airflow.
