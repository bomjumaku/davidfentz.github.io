            I have been fascinated with tensegrity ever since I first cracked open my copy of Synergetics by 
            Buckminster Fuller. If you've never encountered his work, and you're courageous I highly recommend 
            this tome. It is, hands down, the most important work of literature that I have ever (partially) 
            read. I'd put it on the same level as the Bhagavad Gita.
        </p>
        <p>
            I really wanted to explore the possibilities of building tensegrity structures, but I also 
            wanted to play with microcontrollers and learn to solder as I had just gotten my Hakko 
            FX-888D(and I am still in love years later). So, why not combine the two interests? The video 
            in figure 1 shows my first test of the C code which is running the animations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This was really just to ensure that I was driving the LEDs properly before soldering on the other lengths.

            Figure 2 shows the second test. The tower, once built, was to be 4 stories tall, requiring 4 segments 
            of LEDs. I needed to verify that I could run animations across all 4 segments.

            Figure 3 is really a combination of the first two tests, just to verify that all my connections 
            were mechanically and electrically stable before building the tower and attaching the LED strips.

            Figure 4 is the final product. The code linked above is exactly what you see running in this video. 
            Building the tower and learning how to tie a truker's hitch was 1/2 of the challenge and the fun. 
            Unfortunately I didn't capture any of the knotty business on video.
