                I love to cook.

                Mindfulness techniques are an important (and often underutilized) set of tools in my arsenal for maintaining a semblance of sanity in the modern world.

                If I had it my way, I would only wear toe shoes. I honestly can't stand traditional footwear, so I'm almost always wearing some form of minimalist shoe.

                I love coffee, tea, yerba mate, chocolate, etc. I have a lot of respect for the chemical relationships which are formed between man and plant. I'm really a purist when it comes to psychotropic botanicals, and I'm generally picky about what I put on/into my body, so I geek out about how these substances are grown, processed, transported, served, and consumed.

                I love hacking. My next career goal is to become a penetration tester for an independent security firm or a red teamer for a larger business. I am so interested in how computer (and physical) systems are intended to operate, and how they fail to do so.
